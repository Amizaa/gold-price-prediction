"Gold Price Analysis: XAU/USD hangs near three-week lows, just above $1810 level","Gold witnessed some heavy selling on Thursday and dived to near three-week lows.
The technical set-up supports prospects for an eventual break below the $1800 mark.
Attempted recovery move might now confront stiff resistance near the $1848-50 area.

Gold maintained its offered tone through the first half of the European session and was last seen trading around the $1815 region, just above near three-week lows set earlier this Thursday.
Given this weekï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s breakthrough a short-term ascending trend-line, a subsequent weakness below the $1830 horizontal levels supports prospects for a further near-term depreciating move. Hence, a fall back towards challenging 2021 lows, around the $1800 mark touched on January 18, looks a distinct possibility.
Meanwhile, technical indicators on the daily chart have been gaining negative momentum and are still far from being in the oversold territory. Hence, some follow-through selling below the mentioned level might be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders and pave t for an extension of the downward trajectory.
The next relevant target on the downside is pegged near the $1787-86 area before the XAU/USD eventually slide to test November 2020 swing lows, around the $1765-64 region.
On the flip side, the $1830 level now becomes immediate resistance. Any further recovery might be seen as a selling opportunity and remain capped near the ascending trend-line support breakpoint, around the $1848-50 region. The latter coincides with the very important 200-day SMA and should now act a key pivotal point for short-term traders.

Key quotes
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This weekï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s surprise lift in January CPI (Headline rose to +0.9% YoY and core to +1.4% YoY) is not going to provide much solace to ECB. The lifts were largely due to the ending of covid-related, temporary sales tax reductions, interim supply constraints and German emissions charges. There are also other base effects that will be looked through and so the ECBï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s vocal concern in its latest meeting about the long-term lack of any material inflationary pressure is unlikely to be altered.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We expect no change in the policy rate and no clear signal at negative rates (which we now see as even less likely than earlier in the year given the relatively fast vaccination process in the UK). Although the BoE may formally lower its estimate of the lower bound to below zero next week, we donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expect policymakers to hint that negative rates are immart recovering from 2Q onwards), in turn having a limited impact on GBP.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
TDS
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The upcoming BoE meeting should see monetary policy left on hold but downgraded macro forecasts and an update to its thinking on negative interest rates. We think that the BoEï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s conclusions are likely to conclude that while negative interest rates should be part of the toolkit, and that the lower bound for Bank Rate is now below zero, negative rates are not imminent and are unlikely to be implemented in the current economic cycle.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Capital Economics
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The prospect of a rapid recovery in GDP in the second half of the year and a rebound in inflation to 2% suggests that the third COVID-19 lockdown wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t prompt the Monetary Policy Committee to launch a fourth increase in quantitative easing. And although the MPC will probably confirm that it is moving closer to being able to use negative interest rates, we think it will disappoint the markets by not implementing them either this year or ne to leave the policy rate at 0.10%. We also expect the central bank to stay the course on its asset purchases. The votes are likely to be unanimous, too. Even as the news on the future UK-EU relationship and the speedy rollout of the vaccines has been positive since the previous meeting, it seems inevitable that the MPC will downgrade its near term outlook due to the current national lockdown. However, the aforementioned factors should allow the MPC to look beyond the near-term risks and to focus on the trajectory of the recovery. We expect the MPC to strike a fairly confident note, as they have done over the last couple of months. We should also hear more about the review on negative interest rates. We think that, as in August last year, the findings will predominantly highlight the potential drawbacks and challenges of such a policy. This may damp any market expectations of a near-term rate cut.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Citibank
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sharp downward revisions to the growth forecast for 2021 are unavoidable, but we stillBank to remain relatively optimistic on the recovery, forecasting the dissipation of excess supply by mid-2022. The Bank Rate is expected to stay at 0.1% and asset purchases at ï¿½ï¿½895 B. We still expect a 20bp rate cut to -0.1% but in August at the earliest. For now, it seems the MPCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s main aim is to guard against a premature rise in yields in the front-end ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by keeping negative rate possibilities alive (but not necessarily implementing them).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Deutsche Bank
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The MPC is likely to deliver a dovish message, and they see the Bank formally including negative rates in its toolkit, which should lower the bar for further rate cuts. However, no policy changes are expected at this stage, with a unanimous vote from the MPC to keep rates unchanged. Beyond this meeting, their base case is that the MPC will stay on hold for the rest of this year, though risks remain from a longer-than-expected lockdown or a disappointing recovery.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Danske Bank
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We do not expect any policy on whether the BoE considers cutting into negative or not. We expect the BoE to refrain from cutting but keep the possibility open.ï¿½",0,2.4
"USD/JPY climbs to near three-month tops, around 105.25 region","A combination of factors assisted USD/JPY to gain traction for the seventh straight day.
Rallying US bond yields underpinned the USD and fueling the ongoing bullish momentum.
The underlying bullish tone weighed on the safe-haven JPY and remained supportive.

The USD/JPY pair continued scaling higher through the early European session and shot to near three-month tops, around the 105.25 region in the last hour.
The pair prolonged its bullish trajectory for the seventh consecutive session on Thursday and build on the momentum further beyond the key 105.00 psychological mark. The US bond market has reacted strongly amid firming expectations for a massive US fiscal stimulus measures. This, in turn, continued underpinning the US dollar and was seen as a key factor driving the USD/JPY pair higher.
It is worth reporting that Democrats took the first step to advance President Joe Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s proposed COVID relief package without Republican support. The Senate began debating a budget resolution for 2021 with coron spending instructions. While it is unclear how much compromise Republicans are willing to make, investors still expect additional spending of at least $1 trillion.
The USD was further supported by Wednesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s upbeat US economic data, which showed that private-sector employment grew 174K in January as compared to 49K expected. Separately, the employment sub-component of the US ISM services sector report showed a significant increase in the previous month and lifted expectations for the official non-farm payrolls (NFP), due for release on Friday.
Apart from this, the underlying bullish sentiment in the financial markets weighed on the safe-haven Japanese yen and provided an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. That said, RSI on the daily chart has now moved closer to overbought territory and warrants some caution for bullish traders. This makes it prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation before any further appreciating move.
Market participants now look forward to the release of the Initial Weobless Claims data from the US for some impetus later during the early North American session. This, along with the US stimulus headlines, will play a key role in influencing the USD price dynamics. Traders might further take cues from the broader market risk sentiment to grab some meaningful opportunities.

While the outlook for the pair shifted to bearish in the very near-term, it remains constructive when comes to the longer run and is always supported by prospects of a strong recovery in the region (and abroad), which is in turn underpinned by extra fiscal stimulus by the Fed and the ECB.

Concerns about the slow rollout of COVID vaccine in Europe might cap gains.

The EUR/GBP cross edged higher through the early European session and climbed to three-day tops, around the 0.8835-40 region in the last hour.
The cross built on its recovery from sub-0.8800 levels, or near nine-month lows and gained some follow-through traction for the second consecutive session on Thursday. The British poundï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s relative underperformance against its European counterpart could be solely attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the Bank of England (BoE) meeting.
Given the speedy rollout of COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to vote unanimously to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.10% and the size of the Asset Purchase Facility at ï¿½ï¿½895 billion. Hence, the key focus will be on the central bankï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s view on negatis and the updated economic projections.
The third nationwide lockdown might force the policymakers to lower their growth forecast for 2021. This will be followed by the post-meeting press conference, where comments by the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey might influence some volatility around the British pound and produce some meaningful trading opportunities around the EUR/GBP cross.
On the other hand, the shared currency was weighed down by sustained US dollar buying and concerns that the slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccine could hamper economic recovery. This, in turn, might hold bullish traders from placing aggressive bets and keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the EUR/GBP cross, at least for the time being.
Hence, it will be prudent to wait for some strong follow-through buying before confirming that a near-term bottom is already in place and positioning for any further appreciating move.

The US and the eurozone need a more favourable labour market functioning for employees for inflation to return ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ N,"There is concern that inflation will return in OECD countries over the long-term due to population ageing, the energy transition and the shift to regional value chains. But in Japan, there has been no inflation despite population ageing, the energy crisis after Fukushima, the fact that the economy is closed, and the low productivity in services. The example of Japan shows that the functioning of the labour market is decisive for inflation. As long as it is negative for employees, there is no inflation even though other mechanisms are inflationary, analysts at Natixis report.
Key quotes
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Inflation is zero in Japan except in exceptional circumstances: very sharp depreciation of the yen (2013), VAT hike (April 2014, October 2019).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The lack of inflation in Japan is surprising because many mechanisms should have driven up inflation in the country. Population ageing without immigration, the energy crisis following the Fukushima disaster, the fact that Japan is a closed economy that importsing countries and the low productivity in services.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The reason why there is no inflation in Japan is that the dominant factor in determining inflation is the functioning of the labour market. The skewing of income distribution against wage earners in Japan and the weak growth in wages and unit labour costs have kept inflation at zero.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The United States and the eurozone would therefore need a labour market functioning that is more favourable for employees for inflation to return. That is possible: in the United States, for example, President Biden wants to raise the federal minimum wage from 7.25 t",0.17,-1.357
"Breaking: EUR/USD slips below 1.2000 mark, fresh two-month lows","EUR/USD renews two-months as King dollar dominates.
T-yields surge on stimulus hopes, strengthening US economic recovery.
USD bulls cheer cautious market mood as focus shifts to US macro news.

Following a brief recovery stint in the overnight trades, EUR/USD has met fresh supply and breached 1.2000, refreshing two-months low this Thursday.
The main currency pair falls for the fourth straight session, thanks to the broad-based rally in the US dollar across the board. The greenback continues to benefit from the relative strengthening of the US economic recovery, with the recent macro data pointing to further upside risks.
Renewed optimism surrounding the economic recovery gaining momentum has pushed the US Treasury yields higher across the curve, also adding to the upside in the buck. Meanwhile, negative close on the Asian bourses amid Chinaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s liquidity concerns hurt the market mood, lifting the haven demand for the dollar.
On the EUR-side of the story, markets look forward to Mario Draghi taking the h the Italy, Europeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s third largest economy. ï¿½ï¿½Eurozoneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s slow coronavirus vaccine delivery could be also collaborating with the downside bias in the spot.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The pair could drop below 1.20 unless the Eurozone Retail Sales data for December due at 10:00 GMT shows a significant rise in consumer spending. In that case, traders may put a bid under the single currency, helping EUR/USD avoid a move below 1.20,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ FXStreetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Analyst Omkar Godbole notes.
Also, of note remains the US weekly jobless claims and factory orders for fresh dollar trades. Meanwhile, any surprises from the Bank of England (BOE) at its policy meeting could have a cross-driven rub-off effect on the euro.

"AUD/USD eases from tops, up little around 0.7625-30 region","AUD/USD gained traction for the second consecutive session on Thursday.
Rallying US bond yields underpinned the USD and capped gains for the pair.

The AUD/USD pair traded with a mild positive bias through the early European session, albeit lacked any follow-through and remained capped below mid-1.7600s.
The pair edged higher for the second consecutive session on Thursday and recovered further from six-week lows, around the 0.7565 region set earlier this week. The aussie benefitted from a rise in Australian trade surplus in December, though some follow-through US dollar buying kept a lid on any meaningful upside.
Signs of progress on additional US stimulus measures pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond to near 10-month high touched in January. This was seen as one of the key factors that continued underpinning the USD, which got an additional boost from Wednesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mostly upbeat US economic releases.
In fact, the ADP report showed that private-sector employment in the US grew 174K uary. Adding to this, the employment sub-component of the US ISM services sector report showed a significant increase in the previous month and lifted expectations for the official non-farm payrolls (NFP), due for release on Friday.
Apart from this, some cautiousness around the equity markets extended some additional support to the greenbackï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s relative safe-haven status and capped gains for the perceived riskier aussie. This makes it prudent to wait for a sustained move beyond the 0.7650-60 region before positioning for any further appreciating move.

Following the previous dayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s two-way price move, the pair managed to regain some positive traction on Thursday and was supported by sustained US dollar buying. However, the ongoing bullish run in crude oil prices underpinned the commodity-linked loonie and kept a lid on any runaway rally for the USD/CAD pair.
The US bond market reacted strongly amid signs of progress on additional US stimulus measures and pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond to near 10-month high touched in January.

BOE is expected to leave monetary policy unchanged, hints on negative rates will be the key.

GBP/USD stands on a slippery ground near 1.3600 while heading into Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s London open. The quote drops for the fifth consecutive day as traders brace for the Bank of Englandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (BOE) quarterly stint near the lowest since January 19. Also weighing on the quote could be the US dollarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s latest run-up based on cautious sentiment ahead of the key data/events left for publishing during the week.
The US dollar index (DXY) stays positive near a two-month high, flashed the previous day, as pre-BOE and NFP caution joins fears of fresh market frenzy. The reason could be traced from Robinhoodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s latest easing of trading terms for the embattled stocks as wellenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s key meeting with heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss recent volatility in financial markets.
On the other hand, the European Unionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (EU) indirect rejection of the UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s demand to extend the easy border checks between Northern Ireland (NI) and Britain until 2023 also weighs on the GBP/USD prices. Following the UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Cabinet Minister Michael Goveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s push for such a move, British PM Boris Johnson also highlighted the need for urgent action from the EU. While conveying the same, UK PM Johnsonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s spokesperson said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Prime Minister said that we needed urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems with Protocol implementation, to preserve the gains of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and to ensure that Northern Ireland benefits in full from the UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s exit from the EU.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Further, chatters that the EU fears VID-19), as well as British firmsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ downbeat performance due to Brexit exert additional downside pressure on the GBP/USD prices.
On the positive side, the UK reaches a 10 million milestone for vaccinations and is in the top-tier of the global jab race. However, the fears of the South African variant probe the bulls.
Amid these plays, stock futures in the UK and the US snap a three-day winning streak while the US 10-year Treasury yields also retrace the steepest jump in five years.
Looking forward, the BOEï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rate decision and the Quantitative Easing (QE) may have a little importance for the markets but the Quarterly Inflation Report (QIR) and speech from Governor Bailey shouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be missed.

Should the quote manage to cross the immediate hurdle near 0.8835, another falling trend line from January 22 and 100-bar SMA, respectively around 0.8860 and 0.8865, will be the key.

Meanwhile, the latest multi-month low around 0.8795, marked on Tuesday, should stop the bears targeting the early March 2020 high near 0.8740.
In a case where the EUR/GBP prices remain weak below 0.8740, then the 0. 8700 round-figure and April 2020 low close to 0.8670 should gain the marketï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s attention.

EUR/USD struggles to gather upside traction despite signs of bear fatigue near 1.20. The bulls remain on the sidelines, with the US data signaling economic recovery and pushing yields higher.ï¿½ï¿½
Sellers ran out of steam near 1.20 for the second straight day on Wednesday after the pro-EU former European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi accepted the Italian Presidentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s offer to form a government.ï¿½ï¿½
The pair essentially formed a daily candle with a long lower wick, implying bear fatigue near 1.20. So far, however, that has failed to inspire buying. EUR/USD is trading near 1.2020 at press time, having reached a high of 1.2043 in Asia.ï¿½ï¿½
Possibly capping the bounce is the upbeat US economic data released Wednesday. The US ADP Employment and ISM Non-Manufacturing bettered estimates, raising prospen the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s largest economy.

The risks got sold off recently as traders turn cautious ahead of this weekï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s key data/events, todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s BOE and Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s US NFP data. Also challenging the mood could be expectations of retail rush round 2.0 due to the latest steps from Robinhood.

Also on the positive side was the US House Democratsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ victory in pushing President Joe Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s $1.9 trillion covid relief package to the Senate. Further, Global Timesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ news suggesting that the US supports One-China Policy, as well as global vaccine news, play positive tunes that were mostly ignored.
The reason to blame could be Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s meeting to discuss the latest market frenzy by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The fears grew after news that Robinhood, the trading terminal which played a key role in the Gamestop-led saga, increased trading limits for the embattled stocks. Furthermore, the Bank of Englandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (BOE) Quarterly Inflation Report (QIR) and the monthly employment data from the US, up for publishing on Friday, also challenge the sentiment.

Gold also tracks the decline in Silver, as the retail-buying frenzy in the white metal fizzles out. Focus remains on the US jobs data and sentiment on Wall Street for fresh trading impetus.
How is gold positioned on the technical charts?
Gold Price Chart: Key resistances and supports
Theï¿½ï¿½Technical Confluences Indicatorï¿½ï¿½shows that gold is flirting with the $1820 support, which is the pivot point one-day S2.
Minor support awaits at $1815, the Bollinger Band one-day Lower. A failure to resist above the latter, gold prices could fall further to test the pivot point one-day daily S3 at $1812.
The sellers target the previous month low at $1803. However, the pivot point one-week S2 at $1807 could offer sorary reprieve to the XAU bulls.
On the flip side, recapturing the pivot point one-week S1 hurdle at $1824 could expose the $1828 barrier, which is the confluence of the previous high one-hour and pivot point one-day S1.
The previous powerful support now resistance at $1831 could be tested, where the previous week low coincides.
Further up, the bulls could challenge the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day at $1837 en route $1840. That level is the convergence of the Fibonacci 61.8% one-day and Fibonacci 23.6% one-month.

As a result, AUD/JPY traders could reverse the initial losses due to the RBA Governor Philip Loweï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s dovish comments. The reason for the pairï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s upbeat performance could also be traced from virus woes in Japan that pressure policymakers towards another stimulus.
Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures stay 0.11% up intraday but stocks in Australia and Japan drop 0.ime.
Looking forward, a light calendar will need comments from Japan, relating to the likely moves to combat the virus, which have been crossing wires off-late, for fresh impulse.

GBP/USD subdued in the mid-1.3600s as attention turns to Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s BoE m,"GBP/USD fell to the mid-1.3600s on Wednesday amid a further pickup in the US dollar.
Attention is turning to Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Bank of England meeting and anything they might say on NIRP.

GBP/USD fell on Wednesday, a function of a broad pick up in the US dollar that saw the Dollar Index (DXY) continue its gradual grind to the upside to hit fresh two-month highs above 91.30. Back to cable; amid the stronger US dollar, the pair gradually slipped back from Asia Pacific highs around the 1.3680 mark to hit lows in the 1.3620s prior to the start of US trading hours. Since then, trade has been choppier and more mixed, with the price action swinging either side of but for the most part sticking close to 1.3650 level. In the end, GBP/USD finished the day 0.17% or just over 20 pips lower.
Driving the day
There were no specific drivers of GBP weakness on Wednesday and the currency didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t perform particularly badly compared to most of its G10 peers. Sterling seeming remains underpinned by the UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s stellal comparison) vaccination programme that sawï¿½ï¿½the number of people to receive the first jab surpassï¿½ï¿½the 10M mark on Wednesday. Meanwhile, new infections continue to gradually fall suggesting that the peak of the second wave is well in the back rearview mirror. Deaths remain stubbornly high but are expected to start dropping back into the low 100s per day from above 1K per day in the next few weeks.
UK PM Boris Johnson talked vaguely about easing restrictions nationally; it seems likely that when vaccinations hit a certain threshold, at the very least, schools will be reopened and if infections continue to drop at the current pace and the daily death toll follows, restrictions on non-essential businesses will likely be eased.
Meanwhile, tensions between the UK, Ireland and EU over customs checks on the Northern Ireland/Ireland border are yet toï¿½ï¿½meaningful impact GBP, but are worth keeping one eye on for any spill-over into the broader UK/EU relationship (perhaps damaging the ability of the two se on a broad services deal). UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove will hold a meeting with EU Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on the issue next week. Reuters reported that EU sources were expressing concern regarding a letter from Gove.
Looking ahead, focus will tomorrow be on the release of the latest Bank of England Monetary Policy decision at 12:00GMT. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to maintain the bankï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Base Rate at 0.1% and the size of its Asset Purchase Facility at ï¿½ï¿½895B via a unanimous vote. The bank is also expected to outline its decision on whether or not to include the potential use of negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in its monetary policy toolbox. If the bank does opt to add NIRP to the toolbox, Governor Andrew Bailey is likely to attempt to push back on any expectations that the policy will be employed immediately.
The fact that the UK avoided a no-deal exit from the European Unionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s single market at the end of last year and the rapid progress of the UKï¿½ï¿½ sforts are both causes for optimism at the bank, whilst the fact that the country was thrown back into a national lockdown at the end of last year is a negative, although lockdowns are at this point having much less of a damaging impact on economic activity. The MPC will release updated economic forecasts; analysts suspect the economic growth forecast for 2021 back in November looks to have been overly optimistic, so a downgrade is likely.

Other than the stimulus talks, vaccine news was also positive to the mood. Europe is up for getting more vials and fresh data concerning more vaccine trials convey optimism. Additionally, Switzerland and New Zealand give initial approvals to covid vaccines.

Alphabet, meanwhile, surge than 7% following its own strong earnings report on Tuesday.
Driving the day
Growing optimism that the US Congress is going to deliver further fiscal stimulus was the main factor underpinning market sentiment on Wednesday. In terms of the latest on that front; following a meeting between Congressional Democrats and US President Joe Biden in the afternoon, it was agreed (as expected) that Congress should ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½go bigï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ on stimulus. One key development on the day was increasing indications that Biden might be willing to limit eligibility for stimulus cheques, although he reiterated that the $1400 per cheque number was not up for negotiation. Moderate Democrat Senator Manchin said that he believes the Republicans will be willing to compromise on stimulus and that they know their $618B offer (made by 10 Republicans earlier in the week) would be too small. Separately, a Biden advisor said prior to the US cash open that he thought the ultimately agreed on stimulus was likely to be around the $1.3T mark.
andemic related updates out of the US have for the most part been positive; the White House announced that the government is set to open 100 Covid-19 vaccination sites across the country and that the country is now averaging more than 1.3M jabs per day. Meanwhile, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said that Covid-19 infections and hospitalisation appeared on a downwards trajectory, thus deaths are expected to decrease in the coming weeks. Moreover, the prevalence of foreign variants of the virus (such as the more deadly and transmissible UK variant and more vaccine-resistant South African variant) are still thought to be fairly low.
Sticking with the positives; US data was strong. ADP National Employment, a private proxy for the official headline NFP number, beat expectations to come in at 174K (forecasts were for a gain of 49K jobs), while ISM Services PMI also beat expectations, coming in at 58.3 versus consensus forecasts for 57.4.

At present, the precious metal trades around 0.3% or $5 lower on the day.
Driving the day
A stronger US dollar (market analysts suggest that a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½long overdueï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ short-squeeze is underway given prolonged overly bearish market positioning) combined with an upbeat tone to risk appetite that has seen stocks and crude oil markets make further upward strides are both hurting demand for the yellow metal on Wednesday; market optimism is being driven primarily by 1) stimulus optimism, as the budget conciliation process getsress and 2) pandemic/vaccine optimism, as infection rates in key developed markets slow, mass vaccination programmes continue to make progress and new data suggests encouragingly strong levels of efficacy amongst existing vaccine candidates.
Strong US ISM PMI numbers released so far on the week also seem to be boosting market optimism, in that they show a US economy holding up better than feared, right as the economy is expected to be sent into overdrive by the most recently approved stimulus package. This is arguably being taken as a USD positive (and precious metal negative), even if all of the stimulus is going to be funded by debt, most of which is going to be monetised by the Fed, thus further expanding the money supply (a typical precious metal positive).

Bond market signals have been much more positive on Monday; whilst real US yields show a mixed picture (5-year TIPS fell to fresh all-time lows close to -1.86%, 10-year TIPS was broadly unchanged around the mid-1.00s% and 30-year TIPS was unchanged around -0.25%), inflation expectations have rallied; 10-year break-evens are up about 4bps on the day to above 2.17% (implying markets expect US CPI to average 2.17% over the next 10 years) and 30-year break-evens are above 2.15%. Given that precious metals are seen as an inflation hedge, as long as break-evens continue to move higher, this ought to offer precious metals such as gold some respite versus a rising USD and improving risk appetite.

The AUD/USD pair is posting modest daily gains above 0.7600 and looks to snap its three-day losing streak. However, the pairï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recovery seems to be a technical correction amid a dovish shift in the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy outlook.

"WTI slips back from 12-month highs above $56.00, still trades well in the green","WTI surged above $56.00 on Wednesday amid a cocktail of bullish developments.
Though WTI has now slipped back to closer to $55.50, it still trades with solid gains on the day and week.

WTI surged for a third straight day on Wednesday, rallying from around the $55.00 mark during early European trading hours to as high as the $56.30s in wake of the 14:00GMT crude oil pit open (which is often followed by increased volume). However, in recent trade, it appears as though some long have been taking profit and WTI has slipped back to closer to the $55.50 mark.
Still, on the day front-month WTI crude oil futures are up more than 1.5% and trade with gains of well above 6.0% on the week. Needless to say, crude oil hit fresh 12-month highs on Wednesday and the longer-term bulls will be targeting the January 2020 highs just under $66.00.
Driving the day
A number of bullish factors have helped the crude complex post large gains for a third successive day; firstly, the OPEC+ Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee met on Wednesday and agreed to maintain their supply cut policy, a sign which analysts took as suggesting the cartel is happy to see that their supply cuts are draining inventories despite an uncertain demand recovery outlook. On Tuesday, OPEC+ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Joint Technical Committee leaked information that it believes (in its base case scenario) that global oil stockpiles will decline below their five-year average by June.
Secondly, broader market risk appetite is being bolstered by a combination of vaccine and US fiscal stimulus optimism; on the former, the latest update from the US CDC said that over 1.3M vaccines are now being administered per day in the country and that the prevalence of the virus is now in decline. Meanwhile, markets continue to bet that another healthy dose of fiscal stimulus is on the way, with one of US President Joe Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s economic advisors suggesting that he thought a $1.3T package would be the one to eventually pass Congress. For reference, Biden and the Democrats are pushing for a $s package whilst 10 moderate Senate Republicans have made the offer to pass a $618B package (which Biden and the Democrats say is much too small). Either way, a healthy dose of stimulus is on the way and will boost the US economic (and crude oil demand) recovery. Thirdly, crude oil was also boosted by another bullish inventory reportï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Bullish inventory report
WTI saw significant upside in wake of a bullish week EIA crude oil inventory report; as indicated might be the case by Tuesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s weekly private API inventory release, headline EIA crude oil stocks saw a surprise draw of 994K barrels versus expectations for a 446K build. Last weekï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s drop saw aggregate US crude oil stockpiles drop to 475.7M barrels, its lowest level since March 2020.
Cushing stocks also dwindled by 1.517M barrels. Gasoline inventories, however, saw a much larger than expected build of 4.466M (expectations were for a build of 1.134M), but this was not enough to take the bullish edge off of the report. The drop in heaocks, combined with a pick up in the weekly refinery utilisation rate (up 0.6% WoW) points to a demand recovery, argued market commentators.

USD/CAD held below 1.2800 amid strength in crude oil prices,"USD/CAD has for the most part stayed below the 1.2800 level on Wednesday, aided by strong crude oil prices.
Comments from BoCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Schembri about the bank mulling tolerating an inflation overshoot have gone largely ignored.

USD/CAD has for the most part stayed below the 1.2800 level on Wednesday, with resistance in the form of the 50-day moving average at 1.27967 also helping to keep the price action under wraps. Right now, USD/CAD is trading in the 1.2760s and eyeing a test of Tuesday lows. ï¿½ï¿½Break below these lows would open the door to a further move to the south and a test of last Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s low just under 1.2740, which happens also to coincide with the pairï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 21-day moving average. On the day, the loonie trades with modest gains of about 0.1% versus its US dollar counterpart and USD/CAD is down about 10 pips.
Driving the day
USD/CAD paid very little attention to tier one US data releases on Wednesday; for reference, ADP National Employment, a private proxy for the official headlinectations to come in at 174K (forecasts were for a gain of 49K jobs), while ISM Services PMI also beat expectations, coming in at 58.3 versus consensus forecasts for 57.4. The ISM Services PMI report also contained very strong subindex numbers, most notable of which was a jump in the employment index to 55.2 from 48.7 in December (which bodes well for Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s NFP number).
Rather, in recent trade anyway, the pair has taken its cue much more from rising crude oil markets; WTI has rallied into the $56.00s, up nearly 3% on the day amid a cocktail of usual bullish themes including; pandemic optimism (the latest updates out of the US suggest the country is now administering over 1.3M jabs per day and the CDC said the virus is now in a downwards trajectory), growing US stimulus hopes and further indications of strong OPEC+ adherence to agreed supply cuts (Russian Deputy PM Alexander Novak reiterated that the country will aim for 100% compliance).
Meanwhile, a further boost has come in the form of the EIAï¿½ly inventory update; crude oil stocks posted a surprise drop of nearly 1M barrels versus forecasts for a 446K barrel build, confirming bullish private weekly API inventory data from overnight.
Comments from Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri that the bank is mulling whether or not to tolerate an inflation overshoot appear to have gone relatively unnoticed; the bank is currently conducting its monetary policy framework review (scheduled to conclude at the end of the year). Many expect the bank to follow in the footsteps of the Fed and announce some kind of average inflation targeting regime (which implies that after a period of inflation undershooting the BoCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s target, they would tolerate an overshoot). The policy shift is a dovish one, and this is something that could hurt CAD as the year gets underway.

USD: Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s economic policies to favor a weaker dollar ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Capit,"Analysts at Capital Economics think that the United States will return to a more traditional approach to the greenback under Joe Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s administration, and they anticipate that the overall effect of its economic policies will favour a weaker dollar.
Key Quotes:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As in many areas of economic and foreign affairs policy, the Biden administration appears to prefer a more traditional approach. His Treasury Secretary, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, noted in her Senate confirmation hearings that, in her view, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies should be determined by marketsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the United States does not seek a weaker currency to gain competitive advantage.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ However, that does not mean that the Biden administration will be indifferent to the dollarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s exchange rate: Yellen went on to argue that the US should also oppose efforts by other countries to keep their currencies artificially weak.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We think the Fed will maintainpear to anticipate and that, as a result, US yields will not rise nearly as much as they did in previous recoveries. In addition, a looser fiscal stance would boost US growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the global economy and the exports of other economies. That would probably further increase appetite for risk and weaken the dollar, especially against riskier currencies.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our view is that both US fiscal and monetary policy will remain accommodative over the next couple of years ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an overall policy stance similar to that in the immediate post-GFC years, as well as in the early 2000s.

The positive bias has a critical support at 19.95/20.00, the convergence of the 20 and 55-day moving averages. A decline below would point to the resumption of the long-term bearish trend, now being challenged.

Data above expectations, BoE next
In the US, the ADP report showed a surprisingly high level of increase in private jobs during January. Service sector data also came in above expectations, with the ISM rising unexpectedly to the strongest level in two years. The numbers point to a positive surprise in Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s official employment report.
The DXY is trading at 91.10, flat for the day and near the monthly high. The numbers did not boost the greenback, although US yields moved to the upside. In Wall Street, the Dow Jones is falling by 0.12% and the Nasdaq gains 0.15%.
Also, in the UK, service sector data surpasses expectations. Attention now turns to the Bank oand will announce on Thursday its decision on monetary policy. It will be the first post-Brexit meeting. No change is expected. The mentions of negative interest rates will likely have an impact. In 2021, expectations about rate cut from the BoE eased, supporting the pound in the market.

As the US dollar has picked up, however, the bulk of these early gains have now faded.

NZD/USD has now given away most of the gains it made during early Wednesday Asia Pacific trade; the pair rallied above the 0.7200 level and hit highs above 0.7220, up from Wednesday FX open levels around the 0.7180 mark. However, after finding strong resistance at last Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s high 0.7226, the pair has since lost momentum amid a gradual strengthening of the US dollar and has slipped back beneath the 0.7200 mark.
Driving the day
Strong kiwi performance during the early part of Asia Pacific trade was triggered by a stronger than expected Q4 2020 New Zealand labour market report; in the final quarter of last year, employment in the NZ economy posted a surprise 0.6% QoQ expansion, well above market expectations for a 0.8% drop in the total level of employment in the quarter. Thus, the unemployment rate for the quarte in at 4.9%, a drop from Q3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 5.3% rate and well below expectations for a rise to a 5.6% unemployment rate.
According to Capital Economics, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the fall in the unemployment rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ means the rate is already past the peak and we expect the labour market to continue to tighten throughout 2021ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The economic consultancy thinks the unemployment rate will fall to near 4% by the end of 2022.
On the implications for the RBNZ, CapEco notes that the data came in significantly better than the bankï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s forecasts. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our view that the labour market is set to tighten much faster than the RBNZ anticipates is one reason why we expect the Bank to begin raising rates by the end of next yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ they conclude.
The currency has lost some steam since the Asia Pacific session amid the aforementioned pick up in the US dollar, but is still one of the best performing G10 currencies on the day.
Looking ahead for the Kiwi, preliminary ANZ Business Confidence data for February will be releas some attention. But for the most part, NZD/USD focus will return to US dollar dynamics; i.e. focus will be on Fridayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s US labour market report, any further progress made towards another round of fiscal stimulus in the US Congress and whether or not the USD continues to grind higher amid what is being touted as an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½overdueï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ short-squeeze.

Wednesday has thus far seen low volatility in the EUR/GBP exchange rate, though the prevailing trend of a gradual grind to the downside looks to still be in play and EUR/GBP bears will be looking for a more convincing break below the 0.8800 level to come soon. Market analysts continue to cite the comparatively more efficient mass vaccination drive in the UK versus the EU as a EUR/GBP negative, given ths faster vaccination drive is likely to result in the country reaching herd immunity comparatively sooner and then being able to reopen its economy earlier, setting the stage for a faster economic rebound in 2021.
Wednesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s lack of significant volatility in the EUR/GBP pairing obscures the fact that, behind the scenes, there have been some important fundamental developments in the Eurozone;
Firstly, a new path out of the Italian political crisis is opening up; Italian President Sergio Mattarella has given former ECB President Mario Draghi an official mandate to form a government as PM. Whether he can coral enough support to build a majority in parliament is yet to be seen, but Italian financial markets seem to like the sound of a Draghi Premiership (the FTSE MIB is up 1.8% on the day and is the best performing Italian bourse, BTP yields are down over 7bps and the Bund/BTP spread is down more than 8bps).
Meanwhile, Final Eurozone Services and Composite PMI numbers were revised up from the flash estimd the preliminary estimate of Consumer Price Inflation in the bloc for January came in significantly higher than expected; on the latter, most of this large upside beat was put down to transitory factors, though it will be worth watching to see whether this pick up in prices over the coming months has any legs. If it does, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is there much the ECB can do about?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ asks the market.
Turning to UK domestic news, there hasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t been much thus far this Wednesday, aside from a slight upwards revision to final UK services and composite PMI numbers for January. Meanwhile, the country passed the 10M milestone in terms of people who have now received their first Covid-19 jab. Sterling traders have their focus firmly set on Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Bank of England meeting; on which note, the Timesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ shadow Monetary Policy Committee recommended that the bank leave interest rates unchanged this week and that whilst negative rates should be added to the bankï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s toolkit, they should be left",0,-3.54

US: Looser fiscal stance to weaken the dollar ï¿½ï¿½,"Economists at Capital Economics think that the US will return to a more traditional approach to the greenback under Joe Biden and anticipate that the overall effect of his economic policies will favour a weaker dollar.
Key quotes
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If the Biden administration were successful in its ambition to reduce FX intervention, the result probably would be to weaken the dollar, by limiting demand from the foreign official sector. So even if it is expressed in different terms, Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s preference, like Trumpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, appears to be for a weaker dollar.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The more important factors for how the dollar fares under Biden will probably be his fiscal policy, and how the Fed responds to it. Our view is that both US fiscal and monetary policy will remain accommodative over the next couple of years ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an overall policy stance similar to that in the immediate post-GFC years, as well as in the early 2000s. Just as it did on those occasions, we think that this policy mi",0,-0.25
US Dollar Index turns negative near 90.10 post-ISM,"DXY fades the initial advance and returns to 91.10.
The ADP came in above estimates in January.
US ISM Non-Manufacturing also surprised to the upside.

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback vs. a bundle of its main competitors, recedes to the 90.15/10 band following earlier 2021 tops around 90.30.
US Dollar Index looks to yields for direction
The index halts three consecutive sessions with losses on Wednesday after recording new yearly peaks around 90.30.
As usual in past sessions, the positive performance of US yields, particularly the 10-year benchmark, has been lending oxygen to the move higher in DXY. Rumours of Fedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s tapering (despite Powell and various FOMC members considered the idea as premature), the reflation trade, extra stimulus and a faster economic recovery in the US when compared with its G10 peers have been all supporting the current move in the dollar.
In the US docket, the ADP report came in at 174K in January, beating expectations. Additional data showed the ISM Non-cturing at 58.7, also above consensus.
What to look for around USD
DXY regained upside traction and clinched new YTD highs above 91.00 on Tuesday on the back of the renewed offered bias in the risk-associated universe. The continuation of the uptrend in the dollar, however, is forecast to remain somewhat contained amidst the fragile outlook for the currency in the medium/longer-term, and always against the backdrop of the current massive monetary/fiscal stimulus in the US economy, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lower for longerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ stance from the Fed and prospects of a strong recovery in the global economy.
US Dollar Index relevant levels
At the moment, the index is retreating 0.07% at 91.12 and faces initial support at 90.42 (21-day SMA) followed by 89.20 (2021 low Jan.6) and finally 88.94 (monthly low March 2018). On the upside, a breakout of 91.30 (2021 high Feb.3) would open the door to 91.87 (100-day SMA) and finally 92.46 (23.6% Fibo of the 2020",-0.23,-0.25
